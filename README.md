# NR-NTN-satellite
We would like to create a top of html giving a framework of the NR-NTN system tool.
This tool mimic up to 4 satellites, 1 ground station, and 1 handheld device.
The tool allow users to specify (or given realistic satellite service trajectory) satellitesâ€™ trajectory from elevation angle from 20 degree to 160 degree.
The tool models system like LE350, LE600, LEO1200, and GEO altitudes.
The tool allow users to specify start position in elevation angle.
The ground station and the handheld are assume stationary and nearby in Northern Taiwan.
The system computes following using different separated html files each like provide some more detail information.
The main html allow to distribute information to individual html.
We would like to create such framework as the initial issue.
